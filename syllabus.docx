Introduction
Computing for Good (C4G) provides students from various backgrounds the opportunity to gain skills related to social good tech projects. The computing for good domain involves a variety of topics including pre-deployment considerations, architecture, deployment, and sustainability. 
	Students will explore C4G through the creation and deployment of a semester-long project, created either individually or through a team. Projects are chosen by each student and/or team. In the past, these have included topics such as hunger, peace, homelessness, climate change, social justice, etc. Teams may choose their own tools, e.g., Swift, Dart/Flutter, PHP, MySQL, Java, HTML, etc. Case studies of projects, successful and failed, accentuate the team project.
